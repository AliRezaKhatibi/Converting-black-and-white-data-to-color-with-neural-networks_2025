# Converting-black-and-white-data-to-color-with-neural-networks_2025
Building a model using neural networks to convert black and white pixels into color
How can you make a model that colors each pixel one by one? Is it possible, and if the data is a spectrum of different colors, is there a model that can separate these images and by extracting their features, it can convert black and white images into color with high accuracy. 

In this project, a special color spectrum is used and the same colors are black and white, which includes 200,000 photos with dimensions of 32 x 32.
